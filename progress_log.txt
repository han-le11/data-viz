Added gitignore and tried creating an object printing hello.
I am not really sure where to start. I will try out Swing to see how it draws basic structures like line, rectangular, etc.
I have spent around 2 hours on this project so far.
I have planned to start the project later, so I am lagging behind what I presented in the project plans.

I have tried making the DataViz as SimpleSwingApplication. The app runs and opens a panel.
However, as I understand, I'm supposed to make a data visualization library (kind of like matplotlib), not an app (?).

I have been trying to draw simple lines (e.g., from 2 coordinates) and rectangles with Swing, but I haven't figured out how it works.
The materials I have used are the Java Swing demos and Java tutorials on 2D graphics. They're mentioned in the course material.

So far, the difficulty is that I haven't found useful materials/tutorials and haven't had a lot of time for this project, yet.

I have been busy with my bachelor's thesis, and I've just got the news that I'm presenting my thesis next Tuesday, so I have only worked about 3 hours this time.
I have planned to spend more time for this project later.
At this phase, I am lagging behind what I presented in the project plans.

I haven't had time to do anything new since the last interim report deadline (on 30.3) because I have spent a lot of time doing my bachelor's thesis presentation and writing the final thesis version to submit this week. 

I am lagging behind, so I have planned to spend more time for the project.
